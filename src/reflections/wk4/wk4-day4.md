## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentational State Transfer, it means when a RESTful API is called, the server will return to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

## What does Stateless mean?

stateless means the server keeps no record of client requests to it's resources, regardless of other requests by the same client.
