# Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

I will be getting the final tomorrow. I'm honestly not too worried at this point. I feel like we've been throughly prepared for this and it sounds totally feasible to finish before Friday. I plan to spend as much time as possible this weekend on the final and finishing early. If I manage to pull that off then I will have extra time to work on career prep and polishing projects for my portfolio. This course has been great and I honestly wouldn't change anything. I've been more then pleased with Codeworks. Hopefully I can find a job quick!
