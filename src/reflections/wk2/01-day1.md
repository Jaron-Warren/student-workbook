# Read Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions
Today I practiced basic javascript coding. Work: https://github.com/Jaron-Warren/js-tests-basics

## What is Scope ?

* Scope defines where variables can be used, global means the whole document

## What is Hoisting ?

* Hoisting is initializing code at the very top of the global scope before any code execution.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

* let is an improved version of var and should be used by default. Const should be used when you want to protect the data in the variable.
