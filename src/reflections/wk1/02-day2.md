# day 2

Today I learned HTML layout and basic CSS. Emmit inserts and VScode shortcuts
Afternoon lab: https://github.com/Jaron-Warren/HTML-structure-resume21

## Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions

* What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Psuedo-classes in CSS follow another element (element:psuedo-class). I see the :hover psuedo class being the most useful.

* What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

CSS specificity defines how conflicting styles apply and which one.

* What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

everything would be important and so really, nothing would be important.
