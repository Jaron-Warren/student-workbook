# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Abstraction, enacapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff[property] 
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
enclosing something inside of a nested peice of code, removing access from the outside of that code.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single responsibility
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The class is like the blueprint of an object. An instance is a working example of that class that you can store.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A proxy object is a copy of an exsisting object that's disposable.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
MVC design breaks the different parts of a program up, making it easier to ojrganize and go through code. It also provides encapsulation.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the controller takes in input from the DOM and usually just passes it to service. It can clean up data and handle saving, loading, and drawing.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the service runs most of your program logic and changing the appstate.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Models part of the Appstate but have objects and classes as well.
