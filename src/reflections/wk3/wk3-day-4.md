# What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

creating a single data binding between data and elements that is event driven (updates on change)

# What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

subscribe: adds new event, unsubscribe: removes an event, broadcast: executes all events with bound data

# Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
