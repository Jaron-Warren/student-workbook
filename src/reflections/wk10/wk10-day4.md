you can use inheritance to change the type of data in the enum and you may also change the defaults for integer values on creation

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

Haven't used them but we could if we wanted somethign to always return one of many predefined set of values on our server.
