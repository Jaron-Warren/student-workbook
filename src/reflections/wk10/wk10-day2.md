list can be of any type but everything must be of the same type. Almost identical to array's but the length is not fixed and so will grow and shrink with changes.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

list constructors because it's the easiest way to make new lists
list add to add items
list clear to clear out a list
list contains to check if a list has a certain item

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

use list.find to find the first occurrence of an item
